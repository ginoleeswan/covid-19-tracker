<h2 align="right">📖 &nbsp; Lessons Learned</h2>

<div align="right">

&nbsp; I wanted to make a relevent responsive web app needed for todays world.\
&nbsp; My goal was to create an **interactive dashboard** that pulls data dynamically using external API.

&nbsp; This was my first use of **Material-UI** for easier and more efficient component styling.\
&nbsp; Using this framework made the styling process much faster.

&nbsp; Used **Chart.js** library to implement the table. Map was done with **Leaflet**.\
&nbsp; Both components were easy to link up to the API and style.\
&nbsp; Setting up the leaflet map for the first time was complicated due to weak documentation.

&nbsp; **Firebase** was used for deployment which was not that different from gh-pages.\
&nbsp; I plan to explore and use firebase in my future project for simple back-end and authentication.

&nbsp; Optimizing **mobile screen size** was less tedious as styling was implemented in Material-UI.
