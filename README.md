<h2 align="right">📖 &nbsp; Lessons Learned</h2>

<div align="right">

&nbsp; I wanted to make a responsive web app relevent and needed for todays world.\
&nbsp; My main focus was to create an **interactive dashboard** that pulls data dynamically using an external API.

&nbsp; This was my first use of **Material-UI** for easier and more efficient component styling.\
&nbsp; Using this framework made the styling process much faster.

&nbsp; I used **Chart.js** library to implement my table and the map was done with **Leaflet**.\
&nbsp; Both these components were easy to link up to the API and style.\
&nbsp; My first time setting up the leaflet map was a bit complicated due to weak documentation on their side.

&nbsp; **Firebase** was used for deployment which was not that different from gh-pages.\
&nbsp; I plan to explore and use firebase in my future project for simple back-end and authentication.

&nbsp; Again, this app tested my ablilty to fix & optimize for **mobile screen size**.\
&nbsp; However, this time the job was less tedious as styling was neatly organized in a Material-UI implementation.
